# Schedule parser from https://ktmu-sutd.ru

#### Funny little note
- I acknowledge the shittiness of this code
- Couldn't fucking care less
- No one pays me for that
- This is the last version,
no further adaptations in case of changing schedule formats
- L + Ratio

## Overview
This is a regular HTTP REST API server with a schedule parser under the hood.

- Every 10 minutes (configurable) ZIP archives
from specified URLs to Google Sheets are downloaded
- ZIPs are extracted and HTMLs are parsed
- Parsed data is being saved on the disk,
including the time of last update
- Schedule diffs are generated and sent
to the connected WebSocket clients
- Client uses server APIs to view freshly parsed schedules

## API
