# Schedule parser from [ktmu-sutd.ru](https://ktmu-sutd.ru)

Funny little note:
- I acknowledge the shittiness of this code
- Couldn't fucking care less
- No one pays me for that
- This is the last version,
no further updates in case of changing schedule formats
- L + Ratio


## Overview
This is a HTTP REST API server with a schedule parser under the hood.

- Every 10 minutes (configurable) ZIP archives
from specified URLs to Google Sheets are downloaded
- ZIPs are extracted and HTMLs are parsed
- Parsed data is being saved onto the disk,
including the time of last update
- Schedule diffs are generated and sent
to the connected WebSocket clients
- Client uses server APIs to view freshly parsed schedules


## API
All responses are in JSON.
